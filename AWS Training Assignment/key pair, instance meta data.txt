Instance metadata
-----------------
1) Instance metadata is data about the instance which can be used to manage and configure the instance.
2) It can be used to access user data to create instances from custom AMIs
3) It is divided into categories like hostname, security groups etc.
4) These can be accessed only from inside an instance, however its not encrypted.
5) To access the metadata we can use http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ url

Key-Pair
--------
1) It consists of private and public key, which allows us to prove our identity while connecting to EC2 isntances.
2) Public key is stored on the instance itself, while the user stores the private key.
3) For Linux instances, the private key allows us to SSH into the instance using 3rd party clients.
4) For Windows instances, the private key allows us to get admin password which can be used to login into the windows.
5) Private can be used by anyone to access the instance, so it is important to keep it secure.

Elastic IP
----------
1) It is allocated by an AWS user, who owns it till the time it is released by them.
2) It is a static IPv4 address which is accessible through internet.
3) This IP can be allocated to any AWS componet which requires and IP.
4) It is generally used for error handling, ie, quickly allocating the same IP to a new instance if the older instance fails.
5) These IPs are zone specific ie they cannot be moved to another zone.
